Overview
This list should only give you a general understanding of what each of the associated categories should govern. You will still need to use common sense to fill in the blanks and feel free to ask for / debate me for changes. This list is also still in development until further notice. ANYTHING IN YELLOW HIGHLIGHT IS STILL BEING WORDED / DEVELOPED AND IS GENERALLY ASSUMED TO NOT COME INTO GAMEPLAY UNTIL LATER.


PUT DOCUMENT CONTENT SUGGESTIONS BELOW 
*  Ability, skill, and feat descriptions [ in progress ] 
* 

Planned and currently being thought out changes that affect the systems themselves and not specific players will be added below ahead of time when possible and usually addressed in order from top down. If the coming changes are player specific then they will be mentioned directly to those applicable. If you are against these be sure to mention it and explain why, this may not change my mind but it certainly can help prevent them or reduce the scale of them. 


CURRENT CHANGS IN DELIBERATION  
* Creating the Combat Style category bringing physical weapons scaling and progression closer to how magic currently is
* Maybe broadening the weapon training from specific weapons to weapon categories

Actions
Player Actions
* You start your turn with 3 actions; 1 standard / 1 swift / 1 movement
   * Your standard action may be converted into a swift or movement
* You have an unlimited number of free actions, which can only be used during your turn 
* Your available immediate actions, which can be used at any time, start at 1 per round
* Your movement can be used in full or as a 5 foot step ignoring most attacks of opportunity 
      * You may run at x3 speed for a full round action at the cost of being winded { see keywords }
      * You may sprint at x4 speed for a full round action at the cost of being fatigued { see keywords }
Party Actions

   * Requires well furnished and comfortable logging and a full meal before and after
   * Heals 100% of their health { rounded down to the nearest 5th }

   * Heals 1/4th of their health { rounded down to the nearest 5th }
   * Restore 25% of their mana / energy { rounded to the nearest 5th% }
   * Clears Exhaustion
Character Creation
You start with 10 character creation points, the main purpose of them being building the skeleton of your character. These points can and should be used to get anything from stats and abilities to unique equipment and feats, in addition to, allowing you to skip some requirements getting many things early or, in a few cases, unique things that almost only you would have. They also allow the change of things that you won't be able to get or change for quite some time like races and very rare and unique afflictions. A thing to note is that everything has a varying cost depending on a number of factors like power, complexity and prerequisites skipped. Another thing to note is that backstory MAY allow access to unique feats or perks otherwise unavailable to you without a deep involvement in the associating reputations, factions and/or experiences. The cost of stats is 1 to get a +1 modifier but scales up per stat beyond 3 and the max from creation in a specific stat is capped at +2, and you may use the one available flex stat which costs 0 creation points but will reduce a 0 stat down as well as a raise 0 stat up ( this is done after all stats are bought ), this is also the only time you may pick up an increase to your luck stat at the cost of 6 creation points. Should you pick up a magic at any time, either as a mage or sorcerer you will be given a free T1 spell and 2 T0 spells and if you pick up a proficiency in an item you will probably be given a basic version of that item for free.
Leveling
Levels may also be used to acquire most things that can be learned within reason such as spells, abilities, feats, skills, knowledge being the most common, as well as being able to upgrade spells and abilities that you already have up to a cap determined by the primary prerequisite stat that they use. Most feats may be only grabbed once and are generally better than a comparable upgrade, the main way to further these is to grab a separate greater variant that will most likely have higher requirements. You may also spend exp to reroll dice equal to the dice size { ex / 1d8 = 8 exp }. Stats can only be brought up to 20/+5, after that most mortal races need outside help to be able to go beyond the mortal boundary in which your feasibly capable of doing, should you go beyond that boundary it will result in an ascension stat which will be indicated next to the applied stat and 2 of them will allow you to hit +6 and even more to allow you to climb up to 30/+10 also referred to as the “Planar limit”.
100 exp = 1 level { buy 1 stat for 500 exp [ = 5 levels ] { except luck } } /// 10 levels ( pass level 10 ) = 1 stat point { except luck } ( Luck is earned by rolling the same # in a roll on a d20 = 3 + your stat # of times in a row ).
Ability and Spell Tiers
The indication of the general power and difficulty in obtaining them and in most cases higher tiers usually require the others unlocks in said tier, such as T2 and T3 probably need proficiency in their given category. The first tier in a level can usually be grabbed as soon as you reach that level given you have the rest of the requirements, the secondary tier ( T3 / T5 / T7… except T1 ) usually cannot be acquired as you reach that level and in almost all cases will require multiple other things ( at least 2 other requirements ) like a minor in an alt stat, proficiency something else and/or a spell in the previous tier. T0 spells and abilities can be purchased 2 at a time under normal circumstances.
Combat
The Basics
Aside from characters being able to take actions when available, the standard combat rotation goes as follows; determine if surprise actions or rounds exist, then the GM will determine turn order by either initiative rolls, by base Agility modifier, or by pre-combat action turn order, after order is determined follow it, approximately, and repeat. A complete cycle is a round and in a round all turns happen approximately at the same time-ish, and a round is on average 6 seconds but may go up to 10 based on actions taken. Attacking someone that is surprised always treats them as Flat-footed.
* Hp ) A representation of your ability to fight, dropping to 0 puts you in a Critical state and being in that state to long or taking more damage will cause you to die
* Attack ) when referring to an attack roll, it is the roll determining whether or not the attack will land and/or how effective it will be
* AC ) AC refers to the defense stat that determines whether or not a received attack would damage you or secondly if would land on you
* Dmg ) shorthand for damage and refers to how effective an attack is as well as how its effect is dealt
* DR ) a stat referring to damage reduction, standard DR refers to the 3 base physical damages if not specified. This stat directly reduces any damage you would receive that it effects
* SR ) Standing for spell resistance, it works as DR but instead of assuming of blocking physical damage it blocks damage from magical sources not matter the damage type ( except true damage )
Movement
        Bruh
Attacking
        The standard way of attacking is one in which you attack with your trained weapon rolling 1d20+any bonuses that may apply such as a stat modifier or proficiency bonuses. If you attack with a weapon or object you are unable to wield the obvious stat modifier deficiency such as a -1 Str with a longsword the penalty is doubled to where the roll would be 1d20-2. Dual wielding is always an option, or greater forms of superior wielding if you have more appendages to wield with of course, if you are trained in them but if not a penalty will be felt. The penalty if you aren't trained in dual wielding is -3 per extra weapon attempted with and increases the modifier penalty by another factor. Basic dual wielding rolls are rolled as two separate attacks unless stated otherwise. Exotic weapons are also tools available too, but come with a -2 as well increasing the modifier penalty by a factor unless trained. There are also special actions or movements that are available to all entities assuming you meet the most basic of requirements, like having something to grab a target with when trying to grapple, being;
* Coup de Grace { Take a full-round action to make an attack against a helpless target that has guaranteed critical damage, this may be made with a ranged weapon or standard melee weapon but must be within melee range and will always provoke an attack of opportunity from others. Entities of relevant size that suffer the result of this attack must succeed a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 10+damage dealt or suffer death as a result }
* Grapple { make a touch attack to grapple a target, if the targets AC would not be enough to prevent it they may opt for a reflex save to try and dodge it if they see it coming }
* Charge { Full Round Action, Rush at an enemy, doubling your movement, moving at least 10 ft. Attacking the enemy at the end of the charge granting a +2 to attack and damage, however lose -2 AC till next turn }
* Reposition { You can attempt to reposition a foe to a different location as a standard action the DC of which is 10+Str+Agi+End+any bonuses against being moved. You can only reposition an opponent that is no more than one size category larger than you. A reposition attempts to force a foe to move to a different position in relation to your location without doing any harm. Attempting to reposition a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver. You cannot use this maneuver to move a foe into a space that is intrinsically dangerous, such as a pit or wall of fire. This may also be sued to swap places with an adjacent willing ally and does not provoke an attack of opportunity if done this way for either of you }
* Attack of Opportunity { An immediate action as a response to an enemy action or status effect that allows you a basic attack. Common actions that provoke attacks of opportunity are: leaving melee combat, standing from prone, looting, attempting out of combat actions like crafting, }
Targeting
You may, when attacking, decide to try and strike at a specific location in order to cripple the target with an appropriate debuff, but it will also be more difficult to do than a regular attack. 
* REGULAR ATTACK = AC  
   * Good for you.
* TORSO HIT = AC + 2  
   * You hit the target’s torso. The creature takes a cumulative -1 penalty to Fortitude saving throws until the damage from torso hits is healed.
* LEG HIT = AC + 4  
   * You hit the target’s leg. The creature takes a cumulative -1 penalty to Agility saving throws and a -5 ft. penalty to speed until the damage from leg hits is healed.
* ARM HIT = AC + 6  
   * You hit the target’s arm. The  creature takes a cumulative -1 penalty to Strength saving throws and a -1 penalty to attack rolls until the damage from arts hits is healed.
* HEADSHOT = AC + 10  
   * You hit the target directly in the skull. Your attack has its critical range increased by 1 factor in order to increase the chance of a critical hit. The creature makes a Fortitude saving throw against a DC equal to the attack’s damage. On a success it is blinded for 1 round per 10 points of damage (minimum 1 round). On a failure it is dead. If you rolled a natural 20 on the attack roll, the creature dies instantly.


Achievements
Achievements are the result of experiencing and overcoming obstacles or commitment to specific actions or ways of playing and come in many forms such as surviving numerous near death experiences, the commitment to the use of specific weapon or type of magic, traveling along a cursed path or one of the paths of evil and sin or trekking along the good and virtuous paths.
Feats of Glory
Feats of glory allow the acquisition of new and some old feats through the repetition of specific actions or the repeated meeting of certain metrics in an effort to overcome an obstacle of some form. An example is after surviving multiple encounters after hitting and staying at 1 total hp without dropping below 1, you can earn the “On Death’s Door” feat without meeting the proper prerequisites.
Dedications
By proving your dedication to a particular activity or set of actions you may build up active or passive buffs to assist in such things. The time required to gain and/or progress a dedication varies based on the activity and it is extremely difficult to have more than one dedication. Should you falter in your dedication it will regress until it fully disappears.
Cursed Path
There are a number of sinful, dark and/or generally considered evil actions, as such they are shunned and frowned upon at the very least if not outright reviled by most societies. After some time and after continuous and deliberate pursuit and the suffering of a variety of painful afflictions these will become dark boons and such boons will expand into many unique abilities and feats. As an example cannibalism is once such act and after multiple consumption of “playable” races it will afflict you with a -2 to Fort saves, and the continuation of these acts and restriction of available food choices to be nearly all cannibalistic targets cause the afflictions to spread and eventually transform you. Upon transforming into your newfound dark and/or demon form these previous afflictions are now boons and require the cannibalism to continue to survive in addition to increasing these new found buffs and the gaining of new abilities.
Road of Virtue
At any moment a character may declare a self imposed debuff in the pursuit of something higher, and the longer one has this debuff being active and debilitating the more of a chance it is to provide and/or increase the buff being pursued.

Armor & Shields
        The main difference between light, medium and heavy armors is the AC, DR and the agility skill debuffs that come with each armor. Medium and heavy armor can impact some spell casting and will cap your agility stat to +1 for medium and to 0 for heavy but these can be raised with certain feats. In addition, heavy armor halves your move speed unless properly trained. Exotic Armor and shields must be trained in to get the full bonus in addition to getting their own categories proficiency. The agility skill debuff can be reduced but most of those reductions are going to come from your strength stat modifier and feats. Shield sizes are given for an average sized ( 6ft ) medium creature. When looking at the cost, each + represents about 50ish gold in relation to an approximate universal cost for that item.

Equipment Tags
If a item has multiple tags that would increase the same requirements then they are applies additively
* Light = a light weapon does not weight much and is usually a dex based weapon or can easily become one but most often their design is made with such as an expectation { add a minimum +1 Agility wielding requirement to the weapon, and the ability to gain agility scaling if not already possessing one or increase the scaling if it does. If possessing a higher than 1 requirement from this tag increase to the light tag the number following light will refer to the increase in Agi as a requirement such as Light2 has a +2 Agi requirement }
* Long = extended length give the weapon reach but incurs penalty when enemy is to close without training { Will usually come with or be able to gain reach with a feat }
* Martial = a standard military weapon being easier to learn and train with { Suffer no penalties as a result of not being trained in or not meeting the stat requirements and reduces the requirement for proficiency by 1 for its primary stat }
* Deadly = some weapons full potential can only come out when given the proper time to strike, unfortunately this usually only comes out as a finisher in combat { Always crit and assume max damage when using “coup de grace” and when striking helpless targets }
* Flexible = may bend and twist without worry usually for grappling objects and tripping enemies { When trained may use this item for grappling actions and gain +2 for such grappling actions }
* Stealthy = Easily hidden on your person or keep its purpose hidden if you know your stuff and how to keep it hidden in one way or another { Suffer no stealth penalty to hide this item as well as gain +2 to such stealth checks }
* Tool = usually a tool for some profession but can be easily be used as a suitable weapon of choice being able to perform multiple tasks with ease { Suffers no penalty vs relevant targets and gain a bonus +2 damage vs relevant entities }
* Heavy = due to its weight, the weapon cannot be used in its intended way or at all without the proper strength and/or the appropriate training { add a minimum +1 Strength wielding requirement to the weapon, and the ability to gain strength scaling if not already possessing one or increase the scaling if it does. If possessing a higher than 1 requirement from this tag increase to the heavy tag the number following heavy will refer to the increase in str as a requirement such as Heavy2 has a +2 Str requirement }
* Large = size complicates the use of such weapons requiring all of your being to wield them properly and increases the time to do thing with such items { FRA to attack and for attacks made with them, such weapons also usually scale off of Str and their feats will usually go off of Str as a requirement }
* Complex = the weapon is completely unusable without the training, knowledge, and/or physical capabilities to wield it properly { adds +1 to the wielding requirements to each of the scaling modifiers it possesses. Weapon penalty requirements increased by 1 factor }
* Ranged = ranged weapons can fire over long distances but without the training and knowhow usually incur heavy penalties in melee { ranged weapons are ones whose standard attacks and abilities are done at a range and will suffer penalties if done within melee range as well as provoking attacks of opportunity from those with the ability to capitalize on them. Attacks for ranged weapons are given a range and is given in their optimal range and those done outside said given range will have a penalty of -1 per hex outside of it they extend }
* Accurate = due to the accuracy of the weapon wielder need only point and shoot allowing it to scale off of perception but reduces opportunities to do complex shots and maneuvers most of the time { Indicates the weapon will scale of Perception and sight is required to use and target others with in most circumstances }
* Explosive = explosive weapons use blasts to cause damage or launch objects or projectiles but this can come with downsides of not being able to use them under certain conditions and may cause trouble from their use in certain environments { Should you critically fail with an explosive weapon reduce the quality of the item }
* Sturdy = due to the weapons make it’s resistant to most nicks and dents making them last much longer without maintenance { Abnormal resistance to external damaging effects }
* Sharp = the honed edge on allows these weapons to cut even deeper and inflicting more damage as such { Sharp weapons excel at slashing damage and inflict lesser bleed, with feats and/or abilities that build into dismemberment and more bleed but due to focusing it other physical damage alternatives will deal half }
* Piercing = the point is especially designed to puncture and ignore certain armors { Piercing weapons excel at piercing damage and ignore 1 DR, with feats and/or abilities that build into ignoring DR and/or AC but due to focusing it other physical damage alternatives will deal half }

Combat Styles
Upon getting a style with a weapon category you may choose from any applicable style to adjust your fighting style passively by entering your style’s stance, most giving both a buff and a debuff for being in that style’s stance as well as unlocking new abilities to be primarily used in that stance or even upgrading existing ones to gain bonuses while in a style’s stance. As a baseline, it takes a standard action to enter a style’s stance.
* Berserker [ Str Style / Minor Agi / Rage Req ] { Due to your sole focus offense, when entering your berserker stance add +2 damage for each physical scaling on your ( ie: if you have Str then +2 but if you have Str+Agi then +4 ) wielded weapons that you proficient with, while reducing AC by -2 and removing your Agi bonus to AC. Dodge bonuses gained while in this stance add to your attack instead of adding it to your AC. You cannot enter berserker stance while wearing heavy armor }
* Destroyer [ Str Style / Weapon Focus in a Large or Heavy weapon / Savage Strike ] { Enter a stance that lets you embody the word “Destroyer” increasing the strength scaling of types of weapons meant to be wielded by 1 factor ignoring DR equal to the base strength scaling used and increase your destructive bonuses towards objects and environments but these attacks leave you open and should you fail to land them you provoke attacks of opportunity from those nearby }

While in Marksman Stance gain +3 attack and damage to those at and beyond 60ft but lose all Agility and dodge bonuses to their AC }
* Bastion [ End Style / Large Shield or Greater Prof Req ] { When entering your Bastion Stance you must have your large or greater shield equipped. While in Bastion Stance you gain +2 AC and +4 AC vs ranged attacks, but have your movement halved and take -2 attack and damage to your rolls. Entities in the space behind you are considered to be under your protection and you may take any ranged attack that would pass by you to hit them for them instead. Any entity that tries to pass by you may be halted with a successful attack of opportunity even when normally unable to do so }
* Battle Mage [ Magic style / Spellblade Casting / Spell Combat ] { Battle mages mastery of magic through combat has taught them how to seamlessly cast spells in the heat of battle as well as merge them with their physical weapons and tactics, giving your spells a +2 to hit and DC should you have landed a melee attack and visa versa as well as the option to treat both as dual wielded while in melee }
* Assassin [ Agi Style / Stealth Strike ] { Assassin Stance can only be entered while in stealth and may only be active while in stealth, if you leave stealth or if your stealth is broken so too is your stance. Assassins may move their normal movement speed while in stealth without penalties. While in Assassin Stance the base damage from stealth abilities is doubled and the saves from poisons applied by you is increased by 5 but, your AC and DR is reduced by 5 ( this may fall into the negatives and by doing so increase your damage taken and/or guarantee being hit ) }
* Duelist [ Agi Style / Weapon Focus in a One-Handed weapon ] { When you enter Duelist Stance you must mark an opponent and only be wielding Light weapons. While in this stance gain +2 attack, damage and AC vs your mark, all others have +2 attack and damage vs you. If your mark dies you automatically exit Duelist's Stance }
* Blade Dancer [ Agi Style / Prof “Throwing” weapon ] { Blade dancers add agility scaling to all thrown weapons ( including improvised and str based weapons) and double the effective throwing range. During any movement action dancers may use a thrown weapons basic attack ( including acrobatic maneuvers ) as well as retrieve any weapons within a reasonable distance as a free action }
* Combat Ranger [ Agi Style / Point Blank Shot ] { While in Combat Stance, you may choose to use any of your other actions during your movement action ( ie, start moving, shoot, move, swift action, finish moving ) as well as gain a +agility to hit and damage to targets within 45ft but double your agility as a debuff to hit and damage to those at or outside 60ft. Additionally, your attack of opportunity threat range is now 45ft }


Magic 
Magic is the manipulation of the world through the use of mana and applicable knowledge; the main being Arcane, which attempts to use the mana itself as subject focus. Earth, Magnetism and Water as examples of more direct methods of manipulation since they are using the object they’re interacting with as a focus; while Lightning, Fire and Ice are involved more with creation of the element as the focus. Holy, Demonic and Eldritch are examples of using higher powers as the focus for their outcomes; while Psychic, Summoning and Illusion use your mind as the base for the outcome.

Enchanting and Spellcraft
Enchanting
If you have enchanting you may use enchanting to inlay your magic onto the item. You may use  related consumable materials to improve the effect. Depending on your skill and the enchantment you may put multiple enchantments on an item. Basic enchanting typically only allows one enchantment. Overlapping is the process of adding multiple enchantments to an item, depending on the overlapped enchantments they may become mixed and produce a unique enchantment. You only need magic and sometimes items to enchant an item.


Spellcraft
“You are skilled at the art of casting spells, identifying magic items, crafting magic items, and identifying spells as they are being cast.”
Spellcraft typically uses other craftings and magical items to create magic items. Magical items' effects are harder to remove than enchantments. You do not need to know magic to craft a magic item. Later in the game craft magic items are far more expensive to craft however their magical effects are superior to those of enchanting. Magical items can be enchanted, however a variety of factors need to be accounted for to determine whether a specific enchantment can be placed on a magical item.


( DEV NOTES )
Enchanting
* Slots ( Enchantments always take at least one slot / Items have two slots: Core and Surface / Additional slots can be added with the proper accessories )
* Capacity ( Enchantments require available space to be placed on objects / Material affects the base capacity while accessories and size confer bonuses)
* Interactions ( The effects of all enchantments cannot clash with any other enchantment / Temporary enchantments function as any other enchantment )

The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly. You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning level or an item’s caster level. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge Arcana or any similar skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine ( although your accuracy with divine casters is far less and usually spell-like abilities register as arcane ), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use. As with detect magic, you can use this spell to identify the properties of magic items, but artifacts are extremely difficult to do so with. }

Current Crafting Recipes
Damage Types and Effects
* Slashing { Slashing attacks that can cut through flesh or armor which could lead to a bleed effect. E.g. Fighter X lifted his Battleaxe and slashed the Orc’s arm.. And with all the fighting nearing an end, the Orc slumps to the ground, falling victim to unconsciousness through blood loss }
* Blunt { Blunt attacks can smash objects or be used as emergency tools. E.g. Barbarian D swings his Club against the door with great force. The door smashes open revealing not the demonic sorcerer he was looking for, but a harem of frightened belly dancers }
* Piercing { Piercing damage can travel through armor and into soft, internal targets within an enemy or may even travel through one enemy and into another. E.g. Ranger R fires an arrow at the Goblin causing 20 damage. The arrow [Pierces] through the Goblin’s thin skin, killing it instantly. The powerful shot continues to fly on, straight into the chest of a second Goblin moving out of the door, collapsing its lungs. Both Goblins fall, the latter still clutching for air as Ranger R stealthily moves into the camp }
* Force { Force attacks aim to stop, slow or Push/Pull opponents to other areas of combat and the damage dealt by such attacks and others that deal force damage results in effects similar in nature to blunt damage. E.g. Wizard D hurries through the cavern still being chased by the bumbling Magmin. He turns to face his adversary and uses his [Magic Missiles.] The darts fly back into the darkness hitting the creature thrice in the chest. The Magmin is pushed over by the force of the magic and scrambles to regain its footing as Wizard D swiftly continues into The Red Fire Chasm }
* Fire / Heat { Fire damage deals damage through heat and may cause a [Burn] effect to take place. Heat damage is very similar to fire damage but is far less likely to cause things to burn. This could be seen as physical damage per turn or in the disfigurement of a creature due to horrific burn wounds. E.g. And the Ancient Tree Ent was set ablaze, taking 1d6 Fire damage every turn until the fire is put out }
* Cold { Cold Damage could cause one of many effects such as; Physical Damage such as [Frost Burn], The loss of appendages due to [Frostbite], Total incapacitation due to [Freezing] or [Hypothermia]. Eg. Fighter X’s hand becomes frozen to his blade as the Yeti breathes out a plethora of freezing fog }
* Lightning / Electrical { Summoned from the forces of nature, [Lightning] can be wielded as a deadly tool in battle. Causing electrical damage to an opponent, this may take the form of [Electrical Burning], heart convulsions, nerve damage, [Paralysis] or even brain damage. E.g. The Orc Seer called from the sky a great spark of lightning. The Lightning shot from the Seer’s fingertips and into Cleric A. Cleric A’s plate armor crackled with the blue energy causing his muscles to violently contract. Suddenly the shocks stopped to reveal a laughing Orc and a not so happy, slightly crisp Dwarf }
* Sonic { (Sound) Similar to Force damage, Sonic damage can cause opponents to be knocked asunder or be used to create great distractions. Depending on circumstance, a creature may become deafened, disorientated or scared by the sudden application of a sound only 30 decibels quieter than a jet engine. E.g. The ground began to rumble as Druid C uses [Thunder Wave.] The Goblin’s slow their advance as the noise begins to rise until not even the orders from Captain Hob can be heard. Druid C raises her arms in the air and then swiftly pushes them to the ground creating a deafening sound of [Thunder.] Goblins are flung to and fro as the sound wave pushes past them and into the surrounding cave. The Goblins are quick to get up but stand in sheer bewilderment as Captain Hob angrily points out of the cave, screaming only silence. Druid C had finally escaped the Goblin’s Lair }
* Poison { (Toxin) A player usually must be bitten in order to be [Poisoned] however an [Acid] can also hold poisonous properties. Poison acts to immobilize/maim or kill a player over time. E.g. The toxins from Rogue G’s [Poisoned] knife quickly traveled through the guard's body causing him to become paralyzed. Stiff and unresponsive, yet completely aware of his surroundings and his person, Rouge G enters the room with a smile on his face }
* Acid { (Corrosion) Acid can be found from dark magic, chemicals or even beasts and aims to inflict instant damage as well as corrosive effect over time. E.g. Druid H fails a Dex saving throw from an Ankheg [Acid Spray] taking 3d6 [Acid] damage. The DM decides that the acid sprays the Druid’s wooden shield, causing a corrosive effect over 4 turns. At the end of turn 4, the shield is rendered useless and it melts away in front of the Druid’s eyes }
* Psychic { (Mental Durability) There are no general rules to Psychic damage and so can cause a range of effects that the DM can think of depending on the amount of damage done or the content of the spell. Effects may affect the way in which a creature behaves, looks or feels. E.g. Shaman J uses Dissonant Whispers on the Lord sat on the high table, whispering nasty words about the promiscuity of his mother. The lord takes 3d6 [Psychic] damage and begins to twitch frantically. He starts murmuring to himself and looks wildly into the room. Eventually he bursts from his seat screaming, blood oozing from his eyes, nose and ears until eventually his eyes explode and he crashes onto the feast in front of him }
* Necrotic { (Decay) Necrotic means to kill or die and so can be utilized in a session as one of many versions of this definition. A player may age rapidly due to cellular decay or organs may simply shut down and creatures may die because of complications. E.g. A shadow uses [Strength Drain] on a creature causing the creature to lose 1d4 Strength every turn. When the creature reaches 0 Strength it dies.

All opponents are considered to have total concealment (50% miss chance) against the blinded character. Blind creatures must make a DC 10 Acrobatics skill check to move faster than half speed.

While asleep, a character takes a –10 penalty on Perception checks and -6 to will saves and cannot attempt Perception checks that rely on vision, but she can otherwise attempt reactive Perception checks to notice changes in her environment that do not rely on sight. For instance, a sleeping character can attempt a Perception check to hear a loud noise, smell a terrible odor, or sense a creature burrowing in the earth beneath her.

For every 6 stacks beyond the required amount multiply the resulting damage by 1 more factor ( 12 x2, 18 x3, 24 x4 ect ) and increase the radius of the blast by 5ft }
* Difficult Terrain { Difficult terrain is any terrain that impedes your movement, ranging from particularly rough or unstable surfaces to thick ground cover and countless other impediments. Moving into a square of difficult terrain ( or moving 5 feet into or within an area of difficult terrain, if you’re not using a grid ) costs an extra 5 feet of movement.

* Squall { a greater variant of Gust, counting as greater difficult terrain while giving +2 hexes of speed if a DC of 12 is passed / stacking with similar effects only increases the duration }
   * Gale { the greatest variant of both gust and squall, counting as impassable terrain and gives flight along the path as long as a fly check of 20 is passed, otherwise you will be thrown along the path taking damage and most likely being knock prone unless you are to be held against an object by said gale / stacking with similar effects only increases the duration }

Infernal corruption causes things to be chaotic in nature and builds up to 10 charges of corruption but afflicting terrain differently. At 2, they gain the Chaotic Tag and are treated as if they are chaotic aligned and are afflicted with confusion. At 4, they start to burn with hellfire dealing 1d6 fire damage but double vs good aligned entities. At 6, stacks they visually start to transform into the source of corruption and are treated as a creature from that source ( becoming immune to hellfire in the case of demonic corruption ) as well as having confusion rolls that would allow them to act normally or attack the nearest creature instead cause them to follow the orders of the nearest source of corruption or attack the nearest good aligned creature if not then lawful and if neither are found within 120ft attack the nearest creature. At 8, they gain a random number of traits related to the source of the corruption and act as if they were the aligned creature in nature. At 10 stacks the change is now permanent and are forever an aligned outsider entity in nature and act as such }
